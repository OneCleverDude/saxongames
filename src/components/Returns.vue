        <div class="h2">Returns & Exchange Information</div>
        <p>Returns - all returns must be SHIPPED within 14 days of your receiving the item - all domestic shipments include a tracking number which is automatically uploaded to ebay. Longer periods of time will only be allowed on a case by case basis. Buyer is responsible for return postage -  a full refund for initial purchase will be made.</p>
        <p>Returned items will be inspected to ensure original stock. Items may be security marked. ALL returns must be in identical condition to original listing unless damage occurred in shipping.</p>
        <p>Damage due to shipping - buyer must contact me THROUGH EBAY, ASAP, regarding any damage sustained in shipping. I do as much as possible to ensure proper packing and safe arrival, but accidents do happen and I understand that. I have a policy of requiring photos of all damage and packaging - ebay allows photos in messages now.</p>

            <p>Attention International Buyers: All console games like PS2 and Wii games are NTSC version (UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED) which is for play in the US, Canada, and Latin America only. Handheld games like Sony PSP, Nintendo DS, and Gameboy titles are non-region specific and will play in any game unit regardless of where you live. Please make sure you can play these games before purchasing. I DO NOT ACCEPT RETURNS BECAUSE OF PURCHASE ERRORS</p>

        <p>**ADDITIONAL INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION**</p>
        <p>There are a few game titles that are banned in countries outside the United States, where I am based. I will not knowingly violate local laws on this subject. At this time my information comes from Wikipedia, so if a buyer purchases a game that is banned in their country but not listed there, Saxongamesny is not responsible for potential customs issues or fines. Do not request that I make an exception, because it is not worth the risk to my business.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Also - international buyers, I must fill out customs forms accurately based on your information, and Saxongamesny is not responsible for any international customs delays, charges, or fees. </p>
