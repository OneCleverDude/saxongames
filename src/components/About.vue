        <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/games.jpg" />
        <p>Saxon Games began as a dream to open a game store in a local college town, of which one of the sports teams is the 'Saxons'. However, the intended location did not work out and so I decided to operate solely online for the time being. So Saxon Games (saxongamesny) was born. The business operates in western New York State near Rochester, sourcing games primarily from local residents, and the ones that can be salvaged are cleaned and restored for sale on ebay.</p>
        <p>Despite the occasionally lengthy restoration process, I enjoy knowing that I am helping gamers around the world find and play old classics, and often saving the games and accessories from the landfill.</p>
        <p>The majority of the Saxon Games catalog can be found in the ebay store at this time, but eventually I hope to migrate the inventory to this website and operate independently.</p>
        <p>Please enjoy browsing the site, the ebay store, and rest assured that Saxon Games strives to bring the highest quality shopping experience and customer service to my buyers. Customers may also follow Saxon games via the Facebook and Pinterest links to the right of the site, as well as the store Twitter feed.</p>
