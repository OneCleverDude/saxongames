                PAYPAL is my only acceptable payment method. Orders cannot be modified or cancelled once payment has been received. The buyer will be responsible for any shipping fees or recovery costs associated with an undeliverable or old/bad address.

                Paypal E-checks I have had a lot of bad experiences with E-checks and would drastically prefer not to be paid this way. If payment is delayed, your item shipment may also be delayed!! Also, your item will not ship until paypal has notified me that the e-check has cleared.

                All PayPal orders are shipped directly to the PayPal approved address listed with the PayPal payment. Please check with PayPal to verify this address prior to making payment.

                Items are packed ahead of time so for an accurate weight for shipping estimates. Saxon Games ships via USPS ONLY.

                Handling charges are allowed by Ebay, and are applied through official software. I try to keep the costs low, but some materials must be purchased. If you object to the additional cost, I apologize but I try to keep it as low as possible. If a buyer is rude about it (as has been the case before), the purchase may be cancelled. If you object but are polite, I will work with you.

                I am aware that the USPS offers free materials. However, they are for PRIORITY MAIL ONLY. This is actually, in the case of most of my merchandise, a MORE expensive way to ship. I package and weigh items individually, and thus almost always charge less due to calculated shipping. I prefer to send first class or media mail (as applicable) instead, as they are cheaper and nearly as fast. Most of my materials are either purchased from office supply vendors or occasionally recycled.

                <div class="fw-bold"></div>
                In the interest of both resource and cost I am recycling some materials for packing. This means some of my listings will have a either a lower handling charge or no charge, as they will include common packing materials such as newspaper, plastic bags, etc. I do my best to make sure all packages are SECURE, so that your item will arrive in the condition it was listed in.

                <div class="fw-bold"></div>
                Poster shipping: the majority of posters will ship in new mailing tubes, which are purchased as other mailing supplies but are more expensive, so there may be a handling charge depending on the size.

                <div class="fw-bold">Combined shipping</div>
                Combined shipping is available for MOST items, as will be indicated on the listing. Items with free USPS First Class shipping may be in multiple shipments. Except in a very few odd/oversize cases, Parcel Post is not available because it is nearly always within a dollar cost of Priority. USPS Priority shipping is available for most items but please note it is NOT included in the free shipping.

                <div class="fw-bold"></div>
                Posters: multiple posters can be shipped together depending on what type - folded with folded, rolled with rolled - no exceptions. Posters and cards may be packaged with recycled cardboard items to keep them safe, as it seems to be the best method. Posters can not be combined other items.
                </div>

                <div class="fw-bold"></div>
                Games:  The weight limit for USPS First Class mail is 13 oz. Therefore games may be combined into multiple packages. If a purchase totals $30 or more, shipping may be upgraded to Priority mail on a case by case basis.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">

                <div class="fw-bold"></div>
                Systems: If you wish to purchase a system from the storefront, and additional games/accessories, I will happily combine them into one shipment in most cases, as the shipping will be Priority mail. The Post Office has made Parcel post effectively the same cost as Priority Mail so it will probably not be offered on most items.

                <div class="fw-bold"></div>
                Promotional items (cards, t-shirts, soundtracks etc): most promotional items can be combined with other items but I reserve the right for extra time on shipping if it becomes complicated.

                <div class="fw-bold">The US Post Office has revised their rules on Media Mail</div>
                However many of the items I offer are eligible so I will continue to offer it on those that meet the criteria. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE PC OR CONSOLE GAME SOFTWARE. A 2009 ruling officially states these items are not eligible. Media Mail is subject to inspection by the Post Office and therefore I refuse to violate their rule.
